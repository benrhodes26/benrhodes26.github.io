I am a Senior Researcher at [Orbital Materials](https://www.orbitalmaterials.com/), where I work on building 3D atomistic foundation models to accelerate new discoveries in Materials Science. I am a main author on the [Orb-v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22570) and [Orb-v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06231) papers, and a primary contributor to the open-source [orb-models](https://github.com/orbital-materials/orb-models) package.


Prior to working at Orbital Materials, I completed a PhD in Machine Learning at [School of Informatics Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics), where I was supervised by [Michael Gutmann](https://michaelgutmann.github.io/). My publications focused on learning and sampling deep energy-based models, but the methods we developed could also be applied to mutual information estimation and Bayesian inference.
