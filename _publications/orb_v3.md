title: "Orb-v3: atomistic simulation at scale"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/orb_v3
excerpt: 'We introduce Orb-v3, the next generation of the Orb family of universal interatomic potentials. Models in this family expand the performance-speed-memory Pareto frontier, offering near SoTA performance across a range of evaluations with a >10x reduction in latency and > 8x reduction in memory. Our experiments systematically traverse this frontier, charting the trade-off induced by roto-equivariance, conservatism and graph sparsity. Contrary to recent literature, we find that non-equivariant, non-conservative architectures can accurately model physical properties, including those which require higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface.
This model release is guided by the principle that the most valuable foundation models for atomic simulation will excel on all fronts: accuracy, latency and system size scalability. The reward for doing so is a new era of computational chemistry driven by high-throughput and mesoscale all-atom simulations.'
